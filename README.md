# Wumpus API

Discord member username & nickname sanitization API. A hosted version is available at https://api.wump.io/v1.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /sanitize`

Produces a key-value map of member IDs → sanitized names.

#### Sanitization Rules

Sanitization is performed in the following order:

1. If the member has any roles specified in `exclude_roles`, skip sanitization.
2. If the member ID is in `exclude_users`, skip sanitization.
3. Use the member's nickname if set, else the username. (Override with the `force_username` option.)
4. Run [Unidecode](https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/) on the name to convert Unicode characters to ASCII equivalents.
5. If a character has no ASCII equivalent, replace it with the character specified in `replace_char`.
6. Collapse any consecutive characters >= `max_consecutive` into a single character.
7. Convert the name to lowercase if the number of uppercase characters >= `max_consecutive_upper`.
8. Dehoist the name if `dehoist` is true, removing any leading non-alphanumeric characters.
9. Strip any leading, trailing, or consecutive whitespace from the name and trim it to 32 characters.
10. If the name is empty, use the fallback name.
