# Wumpus API

Discord member username & nickname sanitization API. A hosted version is available at https://api.wump.io/v1.

> Used in production at [NetherGames Network](https://discord.gg/ng) with over 31,000 members.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /sanitize`

Produces a key-value map of member IDs → sanitized names.

#### Sanitization Rules

Sanitization is performed in the following order:

- Get the member's name (nickname or username).
- If the member ID is in `exclude_users`, skip sanitization.
- If the member has any roles specified in `exclude_roles`, skip sanitization.
- If `force_username` is true or the `name` is `fallback_name`, use the username.
- Store the leading & trailing emoji characters, limited to `max_emoji_leading` and `max_emoji_trailing`.
- Run [Unidecode](https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/) on the `name` to convert Unicode characters to ASCII equivalents.
- If a character has no ASCII equivalent, replace it with the character specified in `replace_char`.
- Strip any leading, trailing, or consecutive whitespace from the name.
- Remove all spaces from the name if the number of spaces >= `max_spaces`.
- Join any single-character words together if the count is >= `max_char_spacing`.
- Collapse any consecutive characters >= `max_consecutive` into a single character.
- Convert the name to lowercase if the number of consecutive uppercase >= `max_consecutive_upper`.
- Dehoist the name if `dehoist` is true, removing any leading non-alphanumeric characters.
- Remove parentheses around single characters if `normalize_parentheses` is true.
- Prepend or append the stored leading/trailing emoji characters.
- Trim the name to 32 characters if it still exceeds the limit.
- If the name is empty, use the `fallback_name`.
