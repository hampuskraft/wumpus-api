# Wumpus API

Discord member username & nickname sanitization API. A hosted version is available at https://api.wump.io/v1.

> Used in production at [NetherGames Network](https://discord.gg/ng) with over 31,000 members.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /sanitize`

Produces a key-value map of member IDs → sanitized names.

#### Sanitization Rules

Refer to the `sanitize_member` method in [`wumpus/sanitizer.py`](https://github.com/hampuskraft/wumpus-api/blob/main/wumpus/sanitizer.py) for the full list of sanitization rules.
